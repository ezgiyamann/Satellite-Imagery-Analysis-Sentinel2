# Satellite Imagery Analysis with Sentinel-2
This project demonstrates the processing and analysis of multispectral satellite data for environmental monitoring.

## Project Scope
- **Data Source:** Sentinel-2 Level-1C/2A satellite imagery.
- **Pre-processing:** Performed resampling and subsetting operations using SNAP software.
- **Visual Analysis:** Created various band combinations (Natural Color, False Color Infrared) to distinguish land cover types.
- **Spectral Curves:** Analyzed spectral reflectance curves for different vegetation types.

## Tools Used
- ESA SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform)
- Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data# Satellite-Imagery-Analysis-Sentinel2
